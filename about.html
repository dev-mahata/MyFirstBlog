                        Hey, I'm Debnath! I've been making websites since 1998 and I currently work as a principal
                        software
                        engineer. I also have a DDR machine in the basement, two cats, and a wonderful partner. I like
                        working out, playing video games, and reading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my spot on the web for writing, projects, tutorials, art, and anything else I want to
                        put out there. On the site, you'll find my notes and all the technical articles I've written
                        over the years. Check out the projects page to see a highlight of my open-source work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no
                        paywall. It's a space for self-expression and to share what I've learned with the world. I hope
                        the site inspires others to make their own creative corner on the web in the uphill battle
                        against the enshittification of the internet.
                    </p>
